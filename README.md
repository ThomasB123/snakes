**Instructions For Use:**

At the top of the page are some buttons with descriptors of what they control to 
the left of them. You can click any of the buttons to change the corresponding 
property either 'up' or 'down'. 

I have implemented limits as to how large or small certain properties of the sketch 
are allowed to be, you can tell if you have reached the limit of what is valid 
because the sketch will no longer refresh when the button is clicked, and also 
because nothing in the sketch will change. 
e.g. maximum number of boxes per row and column is 10, and 
     maximum number of snakes per box is 5. 


**Possible Issues:**

I have tested the page on Chrome and on Edge, and everything works fine in both browsers. 

The HTML page links to "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/0.7.2/p5.js" 
for the p5.js file, possible issues due to this could be if this server is down. 
Commented out in the HTML file are links to my own version of the p5.js libraries, 
but these will not work in my submission because I cannot submit these along with my work.
